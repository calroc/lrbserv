This directory holds the third-party apps on which this project depends.
By distributing them with the source to our own project we can depend on
always having the source to the versions that we know work (because we've
been developing and debugging for them.)

There are a number of ways to install these apps.  Each app has a
directory within it that contains the Python package that comprises the
app.

All you have to do to install the app is unpack the '*.tar.gz' tarball and link or
move the app's package directory into your main project directory.

From the top level directory you can use commands like the following to
unpack and link the apps:

# First change to the third-party dir and uncompress the apps.
    cd third-party
    ls *.tar.gz | xargs -n 1 tar xzf

# Then go into the Django project dir and symlink the apps.
    cd ../lrbserv
    ln -s ../third-party/django-profiles-0.2/profiles
    ln -s ../third-party/django-registration-0.8-alpha-1/registration
    ln -s ../third-party/django-tagging-0.3.1/tagging

etc...


That should do it or you can also use the setup.py scripts to install the
apps in your system.  See the individual packages' documentation for
details of each.
